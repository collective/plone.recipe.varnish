Varnish recipe for buildout
===========================

plone.recipe.varnish is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe to install `Varnish`_. Even
though the name contains the name Plone, there is nothing Plone-specific about
this recipe: it works for non-Zope sites just as well.

PLEASE NOTE: Version 6.x of this recipe now 'supports' Varnish 6.0 LTS only. Template
generation support for older unsupported Varnish versions or the intermediate
development versions have been removed.  Varnish Software (the company) has switched
to a half yearly time boxed release cycles without rigorous quality assurance, from
which an lts version is picked when deemed stable enough.

If you have custom vcl and/or want to use your current recipe, you can keep
plone.recipe.varnish pinned to versions 2.x, or you can use this 6.x version of the
recipe, but provide parameters for a custom download url and custom vcl file.


Configuring it is very simple. For example::

    [varnish-build]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:build

    [varnish-configuration]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:configuration
    backends = 127.0.0.1:8081

    [varnish-script]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:script
    bind = 127.0.0.1:8000
    cache-size = 512M


This configures three buildout parts:

``varnish-build``
    which will download, compile and install varnish,

``varnish-configuration``
    which generates the VCL configuration file,
    sending requests to a backend at 127.0.0.1:8081, and

``varnish-script``
    which runs Varnish, configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 for requests,
    using a 512 megabyte cache.

A wrapper script for the varnish startup command is created in the ``bin``
directory of your buildout.

Please note that the configuration generated by this recipe is specifically
meant for the latest LTS version of Varnish, version 6.0.x .


Area's of interest to look at when you use this recipe
------------------------------------------------------

Even though this recipe tries to provide sane defaults for most parameters for
a drop in placement, there are a few area's of expertise which you can learn
about to understand and test for a performant but stable Varnish set up.

* If you use this recipe, you will use buildout and a common setup for
  'single' projects is that your Varnish will only cache for one Plone site. An
  inherent problem with caching is cache invalidation: when an editor changes a
  page you want to make sure the next delivery for this content item fetched
  freshly from the backend (Plone) site. Plone's caching setup can be configured
  to send a purge requests for changed content to Varnish. The calculated has
  plays an essential role in this type of purging: if the calculated hash from
  the client request is different from the calculated hash on the purge request,
  purging will fail.

* There are clever alternative purge request setups, which can improve freshness
  but you really have to know what you are doing and experience so far is that
  more advanced schemes have broken between Varnish upgrades.

* Especially if you have multiple backends and you let Varnish do the load
  balancing, don't forget to enable the grace-sick and grace-healthy options.
  When the recipe notices there parameters, it automatically enables health probe
  settings in the generated vcl. grace helps serving pages temporarily when your
  backends are temporarily down.

* As soon as a cookie appears on an incoming request, Varnish will not cache the request
  and even store the url in a 'hit for pass' buffer so that subsequent similar requests
  don't get delayed by waiting in the backend request queue. The generated vcl has a function
  which strips off most irrelevant cookies from incomiing requests before they get passed
  to the backend to increas cache hit rate. the __ac cookie is the most notable exception,
  this indicated for Plone a user is logged in and caching should be disabled.

* You can monitor Varnish caching operations in great detail by learning how to
  use varnishlog and the query language, but it will take at least a few hours if
  you have never used this tool before. It is easy to draw the wrong conclusions
  from just poking around a bit in varnishlog and seeing hits or misses.


Virtual hosting
---------------

Varnish supports virtual hosting by selecting a different backend server
based on headers on the incoming request. You can configure the backends
through the backends option::

  [varnish-configuration]
  backends =
     plone.org:127.0.0.1:8000
     plone.net:127.0.0.1:9000

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for the plone.org
host to a backend server running on port 8000 while all traffic for the
plone.net host is send to port 9000.


Zope 2 hosting (with Virtual Host Monster)
------------------------------------------

If you are using Zope 2 as backend server you will need to rewrite the URL
so the Zope Virtual Host Monster (VHM) can generate correct links for links in
your pages. This can be done either by a web server such as Apache or nginx
(placed either in front or behind Varnish) but can also be done by Varnish itself.

The three options are described below.

Option 1 (rewrites after Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *behind* Varnish (or if using
VHM's 'mapping' feature), no extra Varnish configuration is needed.
Just make sure the ``backends`` option directs the traffic to the proxy.

Option 2 (rewrites before Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *in front* of Varnish, no extra
Varnish configuration is needed as long as the original hostname is still retained
in the URL. If the hostname is not retained, you can tell Varnish to direct requests
based on the "path" instead of the hostname.  For example::

  [varnish-configuration]
  backends =
    /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:8000
    /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:9000

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for any request whose
path starts with ``/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone`` to a backend server
running at 127.0.0.1 on port 8000, while request paths starting with
``/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone`` are sent to port 9000.

Option 3 (rewrites within Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have Varnish generate these VHM-style URLs, you can use the
``zope2_vhm_map`` option.
Here is an example::

  [varnish-configuration]
  zope2_vhm_map =
      plone.org:/plone
      plone.net:/plone

This tells us that the domain plone.org should be mapped to the location
``/plone`` in the backend. By combining this with the information from the
``backends`` option a varnish configuration will be generated that
maps URLs correctly.

Load Balancing
--------------

Varnish supports load balancing by configuring a director for a pool of backends.
This director sends the incoming requests that cannot be fulfilled by varnish to
backends in the pool in either random or round robin fashion. You can configure
the director via the ``balancer`` option::

  [varnish-configuration]
  balancer = random

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic to the director,
which will choose a 'random' backend server to fulfill the request if the
content requested is not cached by varnish itself.


plone.recipe.varnish reference
------------------------------

The ``plone.recipe.varnish`` recipe does one or more of the following:

``plone.recipe.varnish:build``
    compiles varnish from sources

``plone.recipe.varnish:configuration``
    generates a VCL-configuration file

``plone.recipe.varnish:script``
    generates a wrapper script inside your buildout that will start Varnish
    with the correct configuration.



Build varnish from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``build`` is based on
`zc.recipe.cmmi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.cmmi>`_ - so all
parameters from that recipe are available here too (but rarely used). These options are available for the recipe part plone.recipe.varnish:build.

Three parameters are different/ extra:

``url``
    Location used for download of varnish sources. Defaults to the latest LTS version.

``jobs``
    Passes the number of parallel jobs to ``make``, defaults to ``4``. Adjust as
    needed to your CPU resources.

``compile-vmods``
    Boolean flag defaults to False, used for building Varnish modules. By defaults,
    the Varnish modules are from `module collection by Varnish Software
    <https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/releases>`_

VCL Configuration Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options are available for the recipe part plone.recipe.varnish:configuration.

``backends``
    Specifies the backend or backends which will process the (uncached)
    requests. The syntax for backends:

    ``[<hostname>][/<path>]:<ip address>:<port>``

    The optional ``hostname`` and ``path`` allows you to do virtual hosting.
    If multiple backends are specified then each backend must include
    either a hostname or path (or both) so that Varnish can direct the
    matching request to the appropriate backend. Defaults to
    ``127.0.0.1:8080``.

``balancer``
    If included and set to either ``random`` or ``round_robin``, this option
    configures varnish to load balance the servers specified by the ``backends``
    directive. Possible values: ``none`` (default), ``round_robin`` or
    ``random``.

``between-bytes-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
    waiting between bytes when receiving data from a backend. Varnish will only
    wait this many seconds between bytes before giving up. A value of 0s means
    this will never time out. Defaults to *60s*, as per Varnish's default
    settings.

``bind``
    Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
    to ``127.0.0.1:8000``.

``connect-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the connection timeout (in seconds)
    for Varnish connecting to a backend server. Varnish will only try to
    connect to a given backend for this many seconds before giving up. Defaults
    to 0.4s, as per Varnish's default settings.

``cookie-whitelist``
    After the ``cookie-pass`` was processed this list is used to to sanitize
    cookie data on the request. Cookie data to be sent to the backend includes
    only cookies with the given namens. Goal is to work better with the
    backend, i.e. detect if user is logged in and adjust caching to ensure no
    authenticated pages get cached. Defaults are optimized for Zope2/Plone:
    ``statusmessages __ac _ZopeId __cp``

``cookie-pass``
    This list consists of lines with a cookie-match and urlexclude in the form:
    ``"cookiematch":"urlexcludes"``. If *cookiematch* applies for the cookiename
    and the current url does not match urlexcludes, the request is passed
    directly to the configured backend bypassing any caching. But if cookie
    applies and url matches urlexcludes, then a lookup is forced. Defaults are
    optimized for Plone, one line:
    ``"__ac(|_(name|password|persistent))=":"\.(js|css|kss)$"``

``first-byte-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
    receiving the first byte from a backend. Varnish will only wait for this
    many seconds before giving up. A value of 0s means Varnish will never time
    out. Defaults to 300s.

``purge-hosts``
    Specifies hostnames or IP addresses for purge ACL. By default ``localhost`` and
    the backends are allowed to purge. Additional allowed hosts are listed here.

``vcl_recv``, ``vcl_hit``, ``vcl_miss``, ``vcl_backend_fetch``, ``vcl_backend_response``, ``vcl_deliver``, ``vcl_pipe``, ``vlc_purge``, ``vcl_hash``
    Insert arbitrary VCL code into the generated config.

``verbose-headers``
    Enable sending extra headers in responses that expose what varnish
    did with the request and the cache status. Useful for debugging
    cache settings and optimizations.
    Possible values: ``on`` or ``off`` (default).

``zope2_vhm_map``
    Defines a virtual host mapping for Zope servers. This is a list of
    ``hostname:ZODB location`` entries which specify the location inside
    Zope where the website for a virtual host lives.

``zope2_vhm_port``
    Defines a virtual host mapping port to use in the VHM URL to send back to
    clients. Useful if there is another port mapping in front of varnish, such
    as haproxy. Defaults to bind port.

``zope2_vhm_ssl``
    If specified, this maps VHM URLs to ``https`` for all requests.
    Possible values: ``on`` or ``off`` (default).

``zope2_vhm_ssl_port``
    Defines a virtual host mapping port to use in the VHM URL to send back to
    clients. Useful if there is another port mapping in front of varnish, such
    as haproxy. Defaults to 443.

``vcl-version``
    Varnish VCL format version.
    If not given it defaults to ``4.0``.

``health-probe-*``
    Settings for backend health probes. Probes are activated if `grace-healthy` is set.

    See https://varnish-cache.org/docs/6.0/reference/vcl.html#probes for a
    detailed explanation of each setting.

    * `health-probe-url`: defaults to ``/ok``
    * `health-probe-timeout`: defaults to ``5s``
    * `health-probe-interval`: defaults to ``15s``
    * `health-probe-window`: defaults to ``10``
    * `health-probe-threshold`: defaults to ``8``
    * `health-probe-initial`: If not given varnish will default to `threshold -1`

``grace-healthy``
    Grace in the context of Varnish means delivering otherwise expired objects
    when circumstances call for it. This can happen because:
    (1) the backend-director selected is down, or
    (2) a different thread has already made a request to the backend that's
    not yet finished.

    If the backend is healthy, accept objects that are this number of seconds
    old. Clients will be delivered content that is no more than number of
    seconds past its TTL.

    Format: number followed by a time unit: ms, s, m, h.

    Defaults to ``None``. If this is set to ``None`` the grace
    feature is disabled.

``grace-sick``
    If the backend is sick, accept objects that are this old.
    See also ``grace-healthy``.

    Format: number followed by a time unit: ms, s, m, h.

    Defaults to ``600s``. Should be greater than ``grace-healthy``.


To test the generated configuration for syntactic correctness, run
``varnishd -C -f ./parts/varnish-configuration/varnish.vcl``.


Create script to start varnish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start varnish as a daemon or in foreground with the given settings. These options are available for the recipe part plone.recipe.varnish:script.

``bind``
    Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
    to ``127.0.0.1:8000``.

``build-part``
    References the buildout part in order to get settings from there. Defaults
    to ``varnish-build``. Set it to ``false`` in order to switch it off.

``cache-location``
    Customise the location for the Varnish file storage.  Option only applicable
    when used with ``file`` or ``persistent`` cache-type options.  Defaults to
    using a file named ``storage`` inside the relevant parts directory
    (eg ``parts/varnish/storage``).  Changing the default location can be
    useful in putting the storage somewhere with quicker read speeds
    (e.g. RAM disk).

``cache-size``
    The size of the cache (limited to 2G on 32bit systems). Defaults to
    256M.

``cache-type``
    Specify the type of cache storage to use with Varnish.
    Possible values: ``file`` (storage for each object is allocated from an
    arena backed by a file),
    ``malloc`` (storage for each object is allocated with malloc; in memory),
    or ``persistent`` (experimental as at Varnish 2.1.4).
    Defaults to ``file``.

``configuration-file``
    Path to a Varnish VCL configuration file to use. Defaults to the generated
    file from the ``configuration-part`` setting.
    If no configuration was generated, this setting is mandatory.

``configuration-part``
    Names the buildout part to get settings from.
    Defaults to ``varnish-configuration``.

``daemon``
    The file and path of the varnish daemon ``varnishd`` to use.
    If not given, it looks for the build part
    (see the ``build-part`` setting)
    and uses its ``location`` setting plus the string ``/sbin/varnishd``.
    If there is no build part, it defaults to ``/usr/sbin/varnishd`` - the
    most common place
    where it's found on many Unix systems. Adjust it if needed.

``group``
    The name of the group that varnish should switch to before accepting any
    request. This defaults to the main group for the specified user.

``mode``
    Specify whether the varnish daemon should run in ``daemon`` or
    ``foreground`` mode.  The latter is useful when varnish is run by service
    supervision tools like daemontools or runit. Defaults to ``daemon``.

``name``
    If specified this sets the name of the varnish instance (defaults to
    the host name).

    From varnishd's manpage:

      Amongst other things, this name is used to construct the name of the
      directory in which varnishd keeps temporary files and persistent state.
      If the specified name begins with a forward slash, it is interpreted as
      the absolute path to the directory which should be used for this purpose.

``runtime-parameters``
    Runtime parameter configuration options. The full list of available options
    can be found in the manpage varnishd(1) for your version of varnish.
    Examples include ``thread_pool_max``, ``thread_pool_min``, ``sess_timeout``.

``telnet``
    If specified sets the hostname and port on which Varnish will listen
    for commands using its telnet interface.

``script-filename``
    Name of the start script file in ``buildout:bin-directory``.
    Defaults to the name of this buildout part.

``secret-file``

    In Varnish 4.X the telnet interface is no longer usable without
    authentication by default. A pre shared key mechanism has been put in place
    which requires both the varnish daemon and a client connection over telnet
    (like the varnishadm tool) to have a shared key to authenticate. By default
    if no secret-file is specified, it's no longer possible to authenticate to
    the telnet interface.

    To disable this security feature (and go back to the dark Varnish 2 & 3
    days) use ``secret-file = disabled``. This is discouraged.

    To enable the secret-file, give the path to a file on the filesystem that
    preferably has random content and is both accessible to the varnish daemon
    and a command line utility like varnishadm.

    An example buildout part to generate such a file could be::

        [varnish-secret]
        recipe = plone.recipe.command
        command = dd if=/dev/random of=${buildout:directory}/var/varnish_secret count=1
                  chmod 600 ${buildout:directory}/var/varnish_secret

    Giving secret-file the location of this file will pass on the secret to
    the varnish daemon when it starts up. Afterwards you can use varnishadm
    with the parameters -T host:port -S /path/to/varnish_secret to connect to
    the admin telnet interface.

``user``
    The name of the user varnish should switch to before accepting any
    requests. Defaults to ``nobody``.
