Varnish recipe for buildout
===========================

plone.recipe.varnish is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe to install `Varnish`_. Even
though the name contains the name Plone, there is nothing Plone specific about
this recipe: it works for non-Zope sites just as well.

Configuring it is very simple. For example::

    [varnish-build]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:build

    [varnish-configuration]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:configuration
    backends = 127.0.0.1:8081

    [varnish-script]
    recipe = plone.recipe.varnish:script
    bind = 127.0.0.1:8000
    cache-size = 512M


This configures three buildout parts:

``varnish-build``
    which will download, compile and install varnish, and

``varnish-configuration``
    generated the vcl configuration file sending requests to a backend
    at 127.0.0.1:8081 and

``varnish-script``
    which runs Varnish, configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 for requests,
    using a 512 megabyte cache.

A wrapper script for the varnish startup command is created in the bin
directory of your buildout.

Please note that the configuration generated by this recipe requires Varnish
4.0.x or later. The ``url`` provided by the recipe points to the
latest tested Varnish release compatible with the generated configuration.


Virtual hosting
---------------

Varnish supports virtual hosting by selecting a different backend server
based on headers on the incoming request. You can configure the backends
through the backends option::

  [varnish-instance]
  backends =
     plone.org:127.0.0.1:8000
     plone.net:127.0.0.1:9000

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for the plone.org
host to a backend server running on port 8000 while all traffic for the
plone.net host is send to port 9000.


Zope 2 hosting (with Virtual Host Monster)
------------------------------------------

If you are using Zope 2 as backend server you will need to rewrite the URL
so the Zope Virtual Host Monster (VHM) can generate correct links for links in
your pages. This can be done either by a web server such as Apache or nginx
(placed either in front or behind Varnish) but can also be done by Varnish itself.

The three options are described below.

Option 1 (rewrites after Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *behind* Varnish (or if using
VHM's 'mapping' feature), no extra Varnish configuration is needed.
Just make sure the "backends" option directs the traffic to the proxy.

Option 2 (rewrites before Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If generating these VHM-style URLs in a proxy *in-front* of Varnish, no extra
Varnish configuration is needed as long as the original hostname is still retained
in the URL. If the hostname is not retained, you can tell Varnish to direct requests
based on the "path" instead of the hostname.  For example::

  [varnish-instance]
  backends =
    /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:8000
    /VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone:127.0.0.1:9000

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic for any request whose
path starts with "/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.org:80/Plone" to a backend server
running at 127.0.0.1 on port 8000, while request paths starting with
"/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.net:80/Plone" are sent to port 9000.

Option 3 (rewrites within Varnish)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have Varnish generate these VHM-style URLs, you can use the **zope2_vhm_map** option.
Here is an example::

  [varnish-instance]
  zope2_vhm_map =
      plone.org:/plone
      plone.net:/plone

This tells us that the domain plone.org should be mapped to the location
/plone in the backend. By combining this with the information from the
**backends** option a varnish configuration will be generated that
maps URLs correctly.

Load Balancing
--------------

Varnish supports load balancing by configuring a director for a pool of backends.
This director sends the incoming requests that cannot be fulfulled by varnish to
backends in the pool in either random or round robin fashion. You can configure
the director via the balancer option::

  [varnish-instance]
  balancer = random

This will generate a configuration which sends all traffic to the director,
which will choose a 'random' backend server to fulfill the request if the
content requested is not cached by varnish itself.


plone.recipe.varnish reference
------------------------------

The plone.recipe.varnish recipe does one or more of the following:

``plone.recipe.varnish:build``
    compiles varnish from sources

``plone.recipe.varnish:configuration``
    generates a vcl-configuration file

``plone.recipe.varnish:script``
    generates a wrapper script inside your buildout that will start Varnish
    with the correct configuration.

Please note that this recipe requires Varnish 4.0.x or later.


Build varnish from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``build`` is based on
`zc.recipe.cmmi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.cmmi>`_ - so all
parameters from there are available here too (but are rarely used).

Two parameters are different/ extra:

``url``
    Location used for download of varnish sources. Defaults to a version tested
    for the selected ``varnish_version``.

``jobs``
    Passes the number of parallel jobs to ``make``, defaults to ``4``. Adjust as
    needed to your cpu resources.

``varnish_version``
    Varnish target version. Default is ``4``.


VCL Configuration Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``backends``
    Specifies the backend or backends which will process the (uncached)
    requests. The syntax for backends:

    ``[<hostname>][/<path>]:<ip address>:<port>``

    The optional ``hostname`` and ``path`` allows you to do virtual hosting.
    If multiple backends are specified then each backend must include
    either a hostname or path (or both) so that Varnish can direct the
    matching request to the appropriate backend. Defaults to
    ``127.0.0.1:8080``.

``balancer``
    If included and set to either 'random' or 'round-robin', this option
    configures varnish to load balance the servers specified by the 'backends'
    directive. Possible values: **none** (default), **round-robin** or
    **random**.

``between-bytes-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
    waiting between bytes when receiving data from a backend. Varnish will only
    wait this many seconds between bytes before giving up. A value of 0s means
    this will never time out. Defaults to *60s*, as per Varnish's default
    settings.

``bind``
    Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
    to ``127.0.0.1:8000``. This setting is only needed if

``connect-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the connection timeout (in seconds)
    for Varnish connecting to a backend server. Varnish will only try to
    connect to a given backend for this many seconds before giving up. Defaults
    to 0.4s, as per Varnish's default settings.

``cookie-whitelist``
    After the ``cookie-pass`` was processed this list is used to to sanitize
    cookie data on the request. Cookie data to be sent to the backend includes
    only cookies with the given namens. Goal is to better work with the
    backend, i.e detect if user is logged in and adjust caching to ensure no
    authenticated pages get cached. Defaults are optimized for Zope2/Plone:
    ``statusmessages __ac _ZopeId __cp``

``cookie-pass``
    this list consists of lines with a cookie-match and urlexclude in the form:
    ``"cookiematch":"urlexcludes"``. If *cookiematch* applies for the cookiename
    and the current url does not match urlexcludes, the request is passed
    directly to the configured backend bypassing any caching. But if cookie
    applies and url matches urlexcludes, then a lookup is forced. Defaults are
    optimized from Plone, one line:
    ``"__ac(|_(name|password|persistent))=":"\.(js|css|kss)"``

``first-byte-timeout``
    If specified, this option configures the timeout (in seconds) for Varnish
    receiving the first byte from a backend. Varnish will only wait for this
    many seconds before giving up. A value of 0s means Varnish will never time
    out. Defaults to 300s.

``purge-hosts``
    Specifies hostnames or ip addresses for purge acl. By default localhost and
    the backends are allowed to purge. Additional allowed hosts are listed here.

``vcl_recv``, ``vcl_hit``, ``vcl_miss``, ``vcl_fetch``, ``vcl_deliver``, ``vcl_pipe``
    Insert arbitrary vcl code into the generated config.

``verbose-headers``
    Enable sending extra headers in responses that expose what varnish
    did with the request and the cache status. Useful for debugging
    cache settings and optimizations.
    Possible values: **on** or **off** (default).

``zope2_vhm_map``
    Defines a virtual host mapping for Zope servers. This is a list of
    ``hostname:ZODB location`` entries which specify the location inside
    Zope where the website for a virtual host lives.

``zope2_vhm_port``
    Defines a virtual host mapping port to use in the VHM URL to send back to
    clients. Useful if there is another port mapping in front of varnish, such
    as haproxy. Defaults to bind port.

``zope2_vhm_ssl``
    If specified this sets VHM URLs to map to https for all requests.
    Possible values: **on** or **off** (default).

``zope2_vhm_ssl_port``
    Defines a virtual host mapping port to use in the VHM URL to send back to
    clients. Useful if there is another port mapping in front of varnish, such
    as haproxy. Defaults to 443.

``varnish_version``
    Varnish target version. It looks vor the buildout-part given in ``build``
    setting in this buildout-part. If it is found it takes the version number
    from the given build part. Otherwise it defaults to ``4``.

To test the generated configuration - for syntactics - run
``varnishd -C -f ./parts/varnis-configuration/varnish.vcl``.


Create script to start varnish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start varnish as a daemon or in foreground with the given settings.

``bind``
    Hostname and port on which Varnish will listen for requests. Defaults
    to 127.0.0.1:8000.

``build-part``
    References the buildout part in order to get settings from there. Defaults
    to ``varnish-build``. Set it to ``false`` in order to switch it off.

``cache-location``
    Customise the location for the Varnish file storage.  Option only applicable
    when used with **file** or **persistent** cache-type options.  Defaults to
    using a file named ``storage`` inside the relevant parts directory
    (eg ``parts/varnish/storage``).  Changing the default location can be
    useful in putting the storage somewhere with quicker read speeds (RAM
    disk etc).

``cache-size``
    The size of the cache (limited to 2G on 32bit systems). Defaults to
    256M.

``cache-type``
    Specify the type of cache storage to use with Varnish.  Possible values:
    **file** (storage for each object is allocated from an arena backed by a file),
    **malloc** (storage for each object is allocated with malloc; in memory),
    or **persistent** (experimental as at Varnish 2.1.4). Defaults to 'file'.

``configuration-file``
    Path to a Varnish VCL configuration file to use. Defaults to the generated
    file form the ``configuration-part``. If no configuration was generated
    this setting is mandatory.

``configuration-part``
    References the buildout part in order to get settings from there. Defaults
    to ``varnish-configuration``.


``daemon``
    The file and path of the varnish daemon ``varnishd`` to use. If not set it
    looks for the buildout-part given in ``build`` setting in this buildout-part.
    and uses its ``location`` setting plus the string ``/sbin/varnishd``.
    Otherwise it defaults to ``/usr/sbin/varnishd`` - the most common place
    where its found on many Unix systems. Adjust it if needed.

``grace-healty``
    Grace in the scope of Varnish means delivering otherwise expired objects
    when circumstances call for it. This can happen because: (1) the
    backend-director selected is down, (2) a different thread has already made
    a request to the backend that's not yet finished.

    If the backed in healthy, accept objects that are this number of seconds
    old. Clients will be delivered content that is no more than number of
    seconds past it's TTL.

    Format: number followed by a time unit: ms, s, m, h.

    Defaults to None. If this is set to None the grace
    feature is disabled at all.

``grace-sick``
    If the backed in sick, accept objects that are this number of seconds old.
    See also ``grace-healty``.
    Defaults to ``600``. Should be greater than ``grace-healty``.

``group``
    The name of the group varnish should switch to before accepting any
    request. This defaults to the main group for the specified user.

``mode``
    Specify whether the varnish daemon should run in 'daemon' or
    'foreground' mode.  The latter is useful when varnish is run by service
    supervision tools like daemontools or runit. Defaults to 'daemon'.

``name``
    If specified this sets the name of the varnish instance (defaults to
    the host name).

    From varnishd's manpage:

      Amongst other things, this name is used to construct the name of the
      directory in which varnishd keeps temporary files and persistent state.
      If the specified name begins with a forward slash, it is interpreted as
      the absolute path to the directory which should be used for this purpose.

``runtime-parameters``
    Runtime parameter configuration options. The full list of available options
    can be found in the manpage varnishd(1) for your version of varnish.
    Examples include 'thread_pool_max', 'thread_pool_min', 'sess_timeout'.

``telnet``
    If specified sets the hostname and port on which Varnish will listen
    for commands using its telnet interface.

``user``
    The name of the user varnish should switch to before accepting any
    requests. Defaults to nobody.

``varnish_version``
    Varnish target version. It looks vor the buildout-part given in ``build``
    setting in this buildout-part. If it is found it takes the version number
    from the given build part. Otherwise it defaults to ``4``.
